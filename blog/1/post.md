# Thoughts on Software Development

*March 2024*

Software development is not just about writing code. It's about solving problems 
and creating value for users. The best software is often the simplest solution 
that gets the job done effectively.

When I first started programming, I thought the most important thing was to write 
clever code. Now I know that clarity and maintainability are far more valuable.

The three most important principles I follow are:

* Write code that is easy to understand
* Keep things simple
* Focus on solving real problems

These principles have served me well throughout my career.
