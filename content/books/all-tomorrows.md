## About This Book

"All Tomorrows" is a work of speculative evolution that chronicles humanity's extraordinary journey across a billion years of evolution. Written by C.M. Kosemen in the early 2000s, this unique book combines science fiction with evolutionary biology to create a haunting vision of humanity's possible future.

The story begins in the near future, as burgeoning population pressures force humanity to terraform and colonize Mars. After a brief but violent civil war between the two planets, the genetically engineered survivors begin a new wave of colonization, spreading across the galaxy. Everything is looking up for the human race... until the colonies encounter the Qu, technologically advanced aliens on a religious mission to remake the universe.

Although humans fight valiantly, the Qu easily overpower humanity; as punishment, the aliens decide to genetically modify the survivors, turning most of them into mindless, animalistic creatures before departing. What follows is a billion-year chronicle of how these modified humans evolve into countless new species, some regaining intelligence and civilization, others remaining in more primitive states.

Originally released as a free ebook and later gaining massive popularity through social media, "All Tomorrows" is both a creative masterpiece of speculative biology and a profound meditation on humanity's resilience and potential for transformation.

## My Take

a horrifying take of post galactic civilization future, but humanity still stands, it was weird to see so many human subspecies, I even imagined if the animals today on earth were humans at some time in the universe, did we encounter qu in the past, or the future?
