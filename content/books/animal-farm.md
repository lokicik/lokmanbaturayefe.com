# Animal Farm by George Orwell

A powerful allegory about revolution, power, and corruption told through the story of farm animals overthrowing their human owner.

## Key Themes

- **Power corruption**: "All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others"
- **Revolution cycles**: How idealistic movements can become oppressive
- **Propaganda and manipulation**: The role of language in controlling people
- **Class struggle**: The dynamics between rulers and the ruled

## What I Learned

- How noble ideals can be corrupted by power
- The importance of education and critical thinking
- How language and messaging shape political reality
- The cyclical nature of oppression and revolution

## Memorable Quotes

> "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."

> "Four legs good, two legs bad."

## Personal Reflection

Read this in school but its lessons about power dynamics and manipulation are incredibly relevant to understanding modern politics and even workplace dynamics. Short but incredibly impactful.
