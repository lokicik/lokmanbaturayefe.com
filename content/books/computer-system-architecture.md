## About This Book

Dealing with computer architecture as well as computer organization and design, this fully updated book provides the basic knowledge necessary to understand the hardware operation of digital computers. Written to aid electrical engineers, computer engineers, and computer scientists, the volume includes: KEY FEATURES: the computer architecture, organization, and design associated with computer hardware - the various digital components used in the organization and design of digital computers - detailed steps that a designer must go through in order to design an elementary basic computer - the organization and architecture of the central processing unit - the organization and architecture of input-output and memory - the concept of multiprocessing - two new chapters on pipeline and vector processing - two sections devoted completely to the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) - and sample worked-out problems to clarify topics.

## My Take

I completed this book in 2025. Looking back, I don't have detailed notes from this read, but it was part of my reading journey during that time.

*This is a placeholder - I may update this with more detailed thoughts if I revisit the book or have stronger memories of it.*
