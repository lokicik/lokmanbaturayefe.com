## About This Book

Forward the Foundation is the seventh and final novel in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, serving as the second prequel and Asimov's final Foundation novel. As Hari Seldon struggles to perfect his revolutionary theory of psychohistory and ensure a place for the Foundation in the galaxy, the great Galactic Empire begins its inexorable decline.

On Trantor, the Imperial capital, Minister of Science Hari Seldon is all too aware that the great days of the Empire are numbered. The mathematics of psychohistory, Seldon's greatest contribution to humanity, has enabled him to predict the future, but only on a large scale. As he refines his equations, Seldon gradually realizes his own role in the history yet to be written.

Meanwhile, danger lurks on all sides. Seldon's loyal wife Dors is growing suspicious about what she considers Seldon's inadequate attention to his own safety. And a monster called chaos is stalking Seldon's life, embodied in a calvacade of crises that threaten psychohistory, the Foundation, and the entire future of humanity.

This is Isaac Asimov's final Foundation novel, published posthumously and representing the end of the greatest science fiction series ever written.
