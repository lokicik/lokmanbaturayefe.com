## About This Book

Foundation and Earth is the fifth novel in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. Golan Trevize, former Councilman of the First Foundation, has chosen the future, and it is Gaia. A superorganism, Gaia is a holistic planet with a common consciousness so intensely united that every dewdrop, every pebble, every being, can speak for allâ€”and feel for all. It is a realm in which privacy is not only undesirable, it is incomprehensible.

But is it the right choice for the destiny of mankind? While Trevize feels it is, that is not enough. He must know. Trevize believes the answer lies at the center of the Galaxy. There, at a place called Star's End, he hopes to find a thirteen-thousand-year-old remnant of the robot that began the human story.

The quest will lead Trevize to discover the remarkable secret behind the planet Aurora, and beyond that to the most amazing discovery of all: the planet Earth... and the primordial crime that set humanity wandering the stars in the first place.
