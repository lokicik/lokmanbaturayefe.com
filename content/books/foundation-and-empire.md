## About This Book

Foundation and Empire is the second novel in Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy. Led by its founding father, the psychohistorian Hari Seldon, and utilizing science and technology, the Foundation survived the greed and barbarism of its neighboring warrior-planets. Now cleverness and courage may not be enough. The Empire—the mightiest force in the Galaxy—is even more dangerous in its death throes. Even worse, a mysterious entity called the Mule has appeared with powers beyond anything humanly conceivable. Who—or what—is the Mule? And how is humanity to defend itself against this invulnerable avatar of annihilation?

Filled with nail-biting suspense, nonstop action, and cutting-edge speculation, Foundation and Empire is the story of humanity's perpetual struggle against the forces of chaos—and the heroes who sacrifice themselves to save what they hold most dear.

## My Take

the wind that started with the first book kept sweeping me along throughout this one as well. The theme remained the same, and there were quite a few time skips again. I really liked how the appearance of the Mule character plunged the entire galaxy into chaos (I also think his identity was easily predictable). Until now, things had been going too well for the First Foundation. Also, I don’t think Hari Seldon was wrong in his fourth appearance in the Time Vault, we’ll probably understand it better later on in the third book where we learn about the Second Foundation
