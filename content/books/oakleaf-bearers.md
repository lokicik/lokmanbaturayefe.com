## About This Book

Number four in the 'Rangers Apprentice' series, this book asks the question: Can sworn enemies fight side by side to save their lives and their kingdom?

## My Take

I completed this book in 2016. Looking back, I don't have detailed notes from this read, but it was part of my reading journey during that time.

*This is a placeholder - I may update this with more detailed thoughts if I revisit the book or have stronger memories of it.*
