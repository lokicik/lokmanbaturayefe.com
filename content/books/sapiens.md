## About This Book

THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER Planet Earth is 4.5 billion years old. In just a fraction of that time, one species among countless others has conquered it. Us. We are the most advanced and most destructive animals ever to have lived. What makes us brilliant? What makes us deadly? What makes us Sapiens? In this bold and provocative book, Yuval Noah Harari explores who we are, how we got here and where weâe(tm)re going. Sapiens is a thrilling account of humankindâe(tm)s extraordinary history âe" from the Stone Age to the Silicon Age âe" and our journey from insignificant apes to rulers of the world âe~It tackles the biggest questions of history and of the modern world, and it is written in unforgettably vivid language. You will love it!âe(tm) Jared Diamond, author of Guns, Germs and Steel For more, visit www.ynharari.com
