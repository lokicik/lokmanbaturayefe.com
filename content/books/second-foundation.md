## About This Book

Second Foundation is the third novel in Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, completing the original Foundation saga. The First Foundation has been defeated, crushed by the formidable mental powers of the Mule. But rumors persist that there is a Second Foundation hidden somewhere at the end of the Galaxy, established to preserve the knowledge of humanity. The Mule failed to find it the first time—will he succeed now?

Meanwhile, men of the Foundation seek the Second Foundation as well, hoping to foil the Mule's plans. But when they find it, will they destroy everything they've hoped to save? And what of the mysterious Seldon Plan—can it survive the chaos that has torn the Galaxy apart?

In this stunning conclusion to the original Foundation Trilogy, Isaac Asimov shows why his series won the Hugo Award for Best All-Time Science Fiction Series.
