## About This Book

Six of Crows is the first installment in Leigh Bardugo¿s new series which takes place in the same universe as her immensely popular Grisha trilogy. If you are unfamiliar with her debut series, this one might be a little confusing as it is written with the understanding that the reader already has a grasp on the world involving Grisha. Bardugo¿s writing immediately drew me in, her world is rich, her characters are complex, and the story line provided plenty of twists that kept me guessing till the end. Though the characters in this novel are in their teens, they could have easily been written as older characters with burdensome backstories and intelligent personalities.

## My Take

I completed this book in 2018. Looking back, I don't have detailed notes from this read, but it was part of my reading journey during that time.

_This is a placeholder - I may update this with more detailed thoughts if I revisit the book or have stronger memories of it._
