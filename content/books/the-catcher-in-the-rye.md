## About This Book

J.D. Salinger's classic of adolescent angst is now available for the first time in trade paperback. Holden Caulfield, knowing he is to be expelled from school, decides to leave early. He spends three days in New York City and tells the story of what he did and suffered there.

## My Take

I completed this book in 2021. Looking back, I don't have detailed notes from this read, but it was part of my reading journey during that time.

*This is a placeholder - I may update this with more detailed thoughts if I revisit the book or have stronger memories of it.*
