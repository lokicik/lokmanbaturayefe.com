## About This Book

"As Gallan, Boyd and DI Asif Malik inch ever nearer to the man responsible for the shooting, they uncover a murderous conspiracy that will take them to the heart of one of London's most notorious criminal gangs. What they cannot know is that they've also embarked on a journey that will lead one of them straight into the rifle sights of the enemy."--BOOK JACKET.

## My Take

I completed this book in 2019. Looking back, I don't have detailed notes from this read, but it was part of my reading journey during that time.

*This is a placeholder - I may update this with more detailed thoughts if I revisit the book or have stronger memories of it.*
