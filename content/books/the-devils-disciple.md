## About This Book

Two stories originally published in Japanese in 1929 in issues of Shinseinen.

## My Take

I completed this book in 2023. Looking back, I don't have detailed notes from this read, but it was part of my reading journey during that time.

*This is a placeholder - I may update this with more detailed thoughts if I revisit the book or have stronger memories of it.*
