## About This Book

With the Ringwraiths in pursuit, Frodo Baggins attempts to get the Ring of Power to Mount Doom where the ring can be destroyed before Middle-earth falls victim to the evil Sauron.

## My Take

I completed this book in 2019. Looking back, I don't have detailed notes from this read, but it was part of my reading journey during that time.

_This is a placeholder - I may update this with more detailed thoughts if I revisit the book or have stronger memories of it._
