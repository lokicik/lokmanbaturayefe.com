## About This Book

Prince Myshkin returns to Russia from an asylum in Switzerland. Embroiled in the intrigues which centre around the ruling classes, he emerges as a combination of the Christian ideal and Dostoevsky's own views. The world created by the ruling classes cannot accommodate the goodness of this idiot.

## My Take

I completed this book in 2019. Looking back, I don't have detailed notes from this read, but it was part of my reading journey during that time.

*This is a placeholder - I may update this with more detailed thoughts if I revisit the book or have stronger memories of it.*
