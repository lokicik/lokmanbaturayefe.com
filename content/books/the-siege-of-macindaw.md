## About This Book

The international bestselling series with over 5 million copies sold in the U.S. alone! The kingdom is in danger. Renegade knight Sir Keren has succeeded in overtaking Castle Macindaw and is now conspiring with the Scotti. The fate of Araluen rests in the hands of two young adventurers: the Ranger Will and his warrior friend, Horace. Yet for Will, the stakes are even higher. For inside the castle, someone he loves is being held hostage. And now the time has come for this onetime apprentice to grow up. Perfect for fans of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, T.H. White’s The Sword in the Stone, Christopher Paolini’s Eragon series, and George R. R. Martin’s Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire series.

## My Take

I completed this book in 2016. Looking back, I don't have detailed notes from this read, but it was part of my reading journey during that time.

*This is a placeholder - I may update this with more detailed thoughts if I revisit the book or have stronger memories of it.*
