## About This Book

A compelling science fiction, The Time Machine is a first-hand account of a Time Traveller's journey into the future. A pull of the lever and the machine sends him to the year 802,701, when humanity has split into two bizarre races-- the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks. Here, his machine is stolen and with the help of Weena, an Eloi he saved from drowning, the traveller is able to retrieve it. Whizzing thirty million years further into the future, he finds a slowly dying earth, where the bloated red sun sits motionless in the sky and the only sign of life is a black blob with tentacles. He returns to the Victorian time, overwhelmed, just three hours after he originally left . . . Credited with inventing the time machine in this masterpiece, the provocative insight of H. G. Wells continues to enthrall the readers. The Time Machine has since been adapted into many feature films and television series, and has inspired many more works of fiction."

## My Take

I completed this book in 2020. Looking back, I don't have detailed notes from this read, but it was part of my reading journey during that time.
