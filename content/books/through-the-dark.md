## About This Book

From the hit series that's soon to be a major motion picture starring Amandla Stenberg and Mandy Moore--now with a stunning new paperback look and an exclusive sneak peek at The Darkest Legacy, the new novel in the Darkest Minds series! Don't miss this breathtaking collection of stories set in the world of the best-selling Darkest Minds trilogy, now in paperback: IN TIME A desperate young man is forced to make a terrible choice between his own survival and the future of a little girl who won't speak, but who changes his life in ways he could never imagine. SPARKS RISE A spark of light brightens a brutal world when a girl named Sam encounters her childhood best friend at the government-run "rehabilitation" camp, Thurmond. Lucas and Sam form a risky escape plan, but sometimes even love isn't powerful enough to overcome unspeakable cruelty. BEYOND THE NIGHT The camps are closed. A tyrant president has been deposed. But for many Psi kids living rough, there is no home to return to, no place for them in a country devastated by the past and anxious about the future. Every day is a struggle for Sam, who knew all the rules at Thurmond and has been thrown into a terrifying and uncertain new life. But there's more at stake than Sam's own survival. She once made a promise to someone she loves, and the time has come to fulfill it. From New York Times best-selling author Alexandra Bracken comes a collection of three hauntingly beautiful novellas set in the world of the Darkest Minds series. In the most harrowing of times, it takes a ferocious strength not only to survive, but to stand up for those who cannot fight their own battles. The characters in these stories--some new, some familiar--face impossible missions, and the hardest of all may be protecting the last flicker of hope in a seemingly endless night.

I completed this book in 2019. Looking back, I don't have detailed notes from this read, but it was part of my reading journey during that time.
