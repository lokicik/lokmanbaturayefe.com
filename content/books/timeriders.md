## About This Book

Maddy, Liam, and Sal were saved from certain death to become agents for TimeRiders, a group created to stop time travel from destroying the world. When a new threat appears-with evil tracing back to World War II- the TimeRiders go back in time to Nazi Germany and then forward into an ever-shifting present, to fulfill their destinies as keepers of time.

## My Take

I completed this book in 2018. Looking back, I don't have detailed notes from this read, but it was part of my reading journey during that time.

_This is a placeholder - I may update this with more detailed thoughts if I revisit the book or have stronger memories of it._
