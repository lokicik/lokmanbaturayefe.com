## About This Book

Tolstoy wrote some incredible novels, but these little fables are quick to read and simply told. The most memorable one describes the fate of a man who lets his greed get the best of him. These four short stories, (What Men Live By, Three Questions, The Coffee-House of Surat, and How Much Land Does a Man Need?) are well worth reading, re-reading, and mulling over.

## My Take

I completed this book in 2020. Looking back, I don't have detailed notes from this read, but it was part of my reading journey during that time.

_This is a placeholder - I may update this with more detailed thoughts if I revisit the book or have stronger memories of it._
