# You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures

Completed this excellent book on JavaScript fundamentals. Kyle Simpson's explanation of closures is the best I've ever read.

## Key Takeaways

- Lexical scope and how JavaScript engines process code
- The real truth about hoisting
- Closures as a natural result of lexical scope
- Module patterns and their evolution

## My Review

This book fundamentally changed how I think about JavaScript. Before reading it, I thought I knew JavaScript pretty well, but Kyle Simpson showed me how much I was missing.

**Rating: 4.5/5** - Excellent technical depth, clear explanations, and practical examples.

## Impact on My Development

- Started using closures more intentionally in my code
- Better understanding of variable scoping issues
- Improved debugging skills for scope-related problems
- Foundation for understanding more advanced JS concepts

This is the first book in the YDKJS series, and I'm excited to read the rest!
