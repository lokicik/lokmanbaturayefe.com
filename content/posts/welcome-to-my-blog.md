# Welcome to My Blog

Hello! This is my first blog post, and I'm excited to share my thoughts with you.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a place to share my experiences as a developer, document my learning journey, and connect with other developers in the community.

## What You Can Expect

- **Technical tutorials** on web development and AI
- **Project showcases** and lessons learned
- **Thoughts on technology** and industry trends
- **Tips and tricks** I discover along the way

## The Tech Behind This Blog

This blog is built with:

- **Next.js 14** with App Router for the framework
- **Markdown files** for writing posts in my favorite code editor
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Dark mode support** for better reading experience

Simple, fast, and developer-friendly! ðŸš€

## My Current Focus

I'm currently working on:

- Backend development at a startup
- Learning about ASIC and FPGA chip design for LLM systems
- Participating in university clubs like IEEE and GDG On Campus
